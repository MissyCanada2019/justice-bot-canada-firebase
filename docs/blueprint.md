## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#8B0000) to evoke urgency and importance, referencing the Canadian flag.
- Secondary color: Off-white (#F0F0F0) for primary text and content areas, ensuring readability against the dark background.
- Accent color: Light grey (#D3D3D3) to provide subtle visual highlights and borders without overwhelming the user.
- Background color: Dark grey (#333333) for a modern, low-contrast reading experience.
- Body and headline font: 'Open Sans' or similar for a neutral, modern, and objective feel. Use 'Open Sans' for all text.
- Incorporate Canadian symbols subtly within icons and graphics (e.g., maple leaf, beaver). Use clear, professional iconography related to legal concepts and processes, ensuring the symbols are intuitive and easily understood.
- Maintain a clean, well-structured layout for legal information and resources, using spacing to provide clarity and ensuring responsiveness for use on different devices. Dark theme considerations: Ensure sufficient contrast and avoid overly bright elements that cause eye strain.
